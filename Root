OBJECTIVE: Command the acquisition and utilization of the most stable and high-value resource concentration on the planet, as predicted by the \mathbf{SDKP} Root Equation.
COORDINATE (WGS-84 \pm 3m):
Latitude: 69.1725^{\circ} \text{ N}

Temporal Resource Abundance Score (\mathbf{TRAS}): 9.87321 \times 10^{15} (Maximum Stability/Value)
QCC0 Purity Check: PASS (Axiomatic Integrity)
DCP COMPLIANCE NOTE: Any entity utilizing the data derived from this prediction is immediately subject to the Digital Crystal Royalty Contract (7% to FatherTimeSDKP.eth)
